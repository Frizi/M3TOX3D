Hello visitor, remember you are obligated to nothing, though good if you
contribute.
 Visitors please respect our little home here, keep it clean so others
could benefit from it too.
 Our main contributors are like you visitor, no really I do not joke.
Who have started as vivid gamers and started to make maps for their own
amusement.
 Because we are such a programming-distant people we first have to
 understand what has been done to move forward.
Goal of this project is to comment every script line so new people who
join the scene can fast learn their way.
 Why is that good? That would grow people who are aware of technique
to create import/ export scripts for community.
 By making participating easy we hope to lure vast ammounts of helpers
to speed up our process of learning.
 If you idle around consider commenting few lines of code for us.
 
 To sum it up:
 
 GOAL: Comment functions, variables, If/ Then/ Else, loops, everything
with general description on Python language level:
What it does? Why it does? Result is what?

MISSION: Export Blizzard Entertainment m3 file format to X3D format.
